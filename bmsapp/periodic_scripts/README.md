## Periodic Scripts

This package holds scripts that the system administrator can select to run periodically, oftentimes
to gather readings for storage into the Reading database.  The system admin selects the scripts
to run through the Django Admin interface.

These scripts are initiated by code in the `scripts/run_periodic_scripts.py` module.
