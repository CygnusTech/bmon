A number of training videos have been developed to explain the features
of the BMON system. The table below summarizes the available videos.

| `Basic Features of the AHFC BMON  | This video shows how to select various various reports and    |
| Web Application <https://bms.ahfc | graphs for each building. The video also explains a number    |
| .us/training/video/basic_features | of graphing features, such as zooming, highlighting points,   |
| /974/941/?hide_back_link=1>`_     | and hiding data series on the graph. These features are common|
|                                   | to all the graphs on the web site, and this video is an       |
| *(9 minutes)*                     | important one to watch prior to watching the videos below.    |

| `"Plot over Time" Chart (Time     | This video explains the "Plot over Time" graph, also known as |
| Series Graph) <https://bms.ahfc.us| the "Time Series" plot. This graph lets you display how one   |

| `Hourly Profile Chart <https://bms| This video explains the "Hourly Profile" chart. This graph    |
| .ahfc.us/training/video/hourly_pro| lets you chart how a sensor's value changes throughout        |

|                                   | frequently and least frequently.                              |
