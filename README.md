BMON is a web-based software application built with the Python Django framework that stores and analyzes sensor data coming from buildings or other facilities. The application was developed by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) to find ways to reduce the energy use and improve the maintenance of some of their buildings. The application presents a simple user interface for viewing data, but includes informative charts such as Histograms and Hourly Profile charts for analyzing the data. Alerts can be set up to text or email individuals if sensor values move outside normal ranges.
